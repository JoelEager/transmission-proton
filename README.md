# Visualization Feature
This branch adds a live visualization rendered in the browser; vibe coded using [Devin](https://devin.ai/).

While Transmission runs, the tool enables Transmission's built-in RPC server and serves a live dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:9191/` (opened automatically in your browser). The page refreshes every couple of seconds and shows:

- Session download/upload totals, live transfer speeds, active time, and torrent counts
- Connected peer counts (total, sending to us, getting from us) plus a per-peer list with client name and transfer rates
- Whether the forwarded peer port is reachable from the internet

Session totals are written to the log file when Transmission exits.

## How it works

The tool writes `"rpc-enabled": true` into `settings.json` alongside the usual `peer-port` update, then proxies a small set of read-only RPC calls for the dashboard. Poll results are also sampled internally so the final session totals can be logged after Transmission exits.

Note that `rpc-enabled` persists in `settings.json`, so Transmission's localhost RPC stays enabled on future launches even without this tool.

## Security posture

- Both the Transmission RPC server and the dashboard server bind to `127.0.0.1` only — nothing is reachable from other machines or the internet. The `rpc-whitelist` is also pinned to `127.0.0.1,::1` as defense in depth.
- The dashboard only proxies an allowlist of read-only methods (`session-stats`, `torrent-get`, `port-test`). Mutating calls like `torrent-add` or `session-set` are rejected with a 403 before reaching Transmission, so the dashboard endpoint can't be used to control the client.
- Your existing RPC authentication settings are left untouched. If you've enabled RPC authentication in Transmission, pass credentials via `--rpc-username`/`--rpc-password`.
- `port-test` makes a periodic outbound request to Transmission's official port-check service (the same one the client's "Test Port" button uses) to report whether the forwarded port is open.

Disable the whole feature with `--no-dashboard`; change the dashboard port with `--dashboard-port`.

# Transmission Proton Helper
Simple tool to update [Transmission](https://github.com/transmission/transmission)'s peer port with a value from the clipboard and launch Transmission. Intended to configure and launch Transmission via Proton VPN using the "Connect and Go" profile option. Includes a log file for troubleshooting and history.

Mostly vibe coded using [Google Jules](https://jules.google.com/).

## Build Instructions
### Prerequisites
- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Building Release Binary
```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable will be available at `target/release/transmission-proton` (or `transmission-proton.exe` on Windows).

## Usage
Simply run the binary:

```bash
./target/release/transmission-proton
```

It should automatically detect the Transmission configuration path and executable for your platform. If not, the defaults can be overridden with command line options. After launching the binary just copy the port number and it should take care of the rest. (Run with `--help` for usage.)
